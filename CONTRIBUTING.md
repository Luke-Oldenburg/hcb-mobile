# Contributing
Thank you for choosing to contribute to HCB Mobile! Please follow the guidelines before on how to contribute.

- Use the PR template
- Preferably, prefix your branch names with your name. e.g. `garyhtou/branch-name`
- Update your branch by merging `main` into your feature branch rather than rebasing. Rebasing will create new commits causing review comments to shift out of order.
- When merging PRs into main, squash and rebase


## Per-merge Checklist

- [ ] Descriptive PR title _(Does the title explain the changes in a concise manner?)_
- [ ] Tag related issues so they auto-close on merge
- [ ] Easily digestible commits _(Are the commits small and easy to understand?)_ [video](https://gist.github.com/garyhtou/97534180b0753aa607c35b6fdda9d2e0)
- [ ] CI passes _(Do the GitHub checks pass?)_
- [ ] Tested by submitter before requesting review _(Does it work in development?)_
- [ ] Tested by two reviewers before merging
